In our research, we analyzed machine learning
algorithms across three medical datasets: Diabetes,
Parkinson's disease, and heart disease, determining the
most effective algorithm for each condition based on
classification accuracy.
For diabetes, the Support Vector Machine (SVM)
outperformed other algorithms with an accuracy of
82.46%, leveraging its capability to construct an optimal
hyperplane for distinguishing between diabetic and
non-diabetic instances. Logistic Regression emerged as
the top-performing algorithm for Parkinson's disease
classification, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 97%,
attributed to its interpretability and robustness in binary
classification tasks. In heart disease classification,
logistic regression and Support vector machine
algorithm stood out with an accuracy of 81.96%,
excelling in capturing complex decision boundaries and
identifying key features for predicting heart disease risk
factors.
These findings emphasize the importance of tailored
machine learning techniques for specific medical
conditions, facilitating enhanced diagnostic accuracy
and timely intervention, ultimately improving patient
outcomes. Machine learning holds promise for
advancing disease diagnosis and treatment in clinical
practice.
